Euler_Test ::A simple code to understand Rotation matrix and Euler angles. The code rotates the frame around Z-Axis by 90 degrees, then around the newly displaced X-Axis by 90 degrees and finally arund the newly displaced Y-Axis by 90 degrees. This sequence is the ISB standard for computating forearm pronation and supination.

Plane_Rotation :: A simple code to test the logic applied to align two segments by using vector maths. It orients one of the points displaced extensively in Z direction to a the same plane as other 3 points.
